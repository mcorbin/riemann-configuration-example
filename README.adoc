= Riemann configuration example

This is a commented, tested Riemann configuration under construction.

Use this configuration to understand how Riemann works.

I will show a lot of things (with fake use cases), and differents ways to build your Riemann configuration. It's up to you to choose the right patterns depending of your use cases ;)
